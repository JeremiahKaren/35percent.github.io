## Campaigners to hold Rally in support

The long-awaited Court of Appeal hearing against the High Court decision to uphold the planning approval for the demolition and redevelopment of the Elephant and Castle shopping centre will be held on the 16 and 17 March 2021.  The hearing will be online and is open to the public. Permission to mount the appeal was granted to Jerry Flynn, of the 35% Campaign, who is supported by local campaigners Up the Elephant.  The planning approval was granted by Southwark Council to shopping centre owner and developer Delancey in 2019.

The permission to appeal follows an unsuccessful High Court challenge in October 2019, when Mr Justice Dove refused to quash the planning approval, after a two-day hearing. 
 
While the demolition of the shopping centre has begun, the legal challenge has focused on the shortage of social rented housing in the proposed development. Delancey has increased the amount of real social rented homes from zero to 116 units under the pressure of a 3-year campaign by Up the Elephant, but it is still only a fraction of the nearly one thousand in the new development.  The social housing could also be at risk, if Delancey doesn’t deliver on the “West site”, not due to be built for another 10 years.

Campaigners also believe Southwark's Council’s planning committee was misled as to the maximum amount of affordable housing the scheme could viably provide and that there could be at least another 42 social rented homes, with help of Mayor of London funding.
