A [report](http://www.spinwatch.org/index.php/component/k2/item/5458-the-local-lobby-and-the-failure-of-democracy) by journalist Anna Minton has found that _"20  per  cent  of  Southwark’s  63 councillors work as lobbyists"_ for developers in the planning industry and that a significant number of Councillors and Council officers are making use of a _'well-oiled revolving door'_ to the industry. This is twice the already alarming [average number](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/29/nearly-100-london-councillors-have-links-to-property-industry) of Councillors working in the property development industry in other London boroughs. Here we have documented a few of Southwark's most striking revolving door examples.

## Councillors

## Jeremy Fraser
<img src="http://35percent.org/img/jeremyfraser.png" style="margin:10px" align="left" height="150">After [kick-starting](http://www.newstatesman.com/node/150435) Southwark's Blairite social cleansing programme, Southwark's Labour Council leader [Jeremy Fraser](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-fraser-362a6a2a) lost his seat in 2002.

The company they founded is called ['Four Communications'](http://www.fourcommunications.com/) and has assisted developers on a [large number](http://35percent.org/2014-10-19-gamekeepers-turned-poachers/) of high-profile and controversial developments in the local area - including [Elephant One](/tribeca-square), [One Blackfriars](/one-blackfriars), [Neo Bankside](/neo-bankside), [Eileen House](/eileen-house), [Strata Tower](/strata-tower) and [Dulwich Hamlet stadium](http://35percent.org/dulwich-hamlet-stadium/). Four prides itself on being able to offer expertise in the form of councillors and other elected members. It counts amongst its emloyees, [Florence Eshalomi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florence-eshalomi-8b55b62b), Lambeth's former deputy Cabinet member for Housing and current [GLA assembly member](https://www.london.gov.uk/people/assembly/florence-eshalomi/more-about) for Lambeth and Southwark.

## Nick Stanton

In 2009, he was [critcised for lack of transparency](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4230) after [selecting Lend Lease](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4712) as the council's development partner in 2007, is now an [Associate Director](http://curtinandco.com/profiles/nick-stanton-obe/) for property development PR company 'Curtin & Co'. On Stanton's profile page for the company he writes _"I enjoy working on strategic allocations enabling controversial sites to come forward for development."_ Under his list of major accomplishments he boasts _"Winning approval at committee for a major development on a greenfield site"_ Amongst others, Curtin is currently advising developers on the controversial [Southwark Metals development](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lib-dem-deputy-investigated-over-lobbying-8395968.html) in Bermondsey for which Stanton's local political party received a donation. Stanton resurfaced working for Shard developer Irvine Sellar in 2013, when he [helped](/img/Regeneration-and-Major-Projects.pdf) Sellar secure planning consent for 1046 new homes at [Canada Water (Decathlon site)](http://35percent.org/canada-water/#canada-water-sites-ce).

This was good news for Newington, as Tom is not only a sitting Councillor but he is also on the Council's planning committee where he is clearly well placed to influence planning decisions. Whilst we are not suggesting any wrongdoing, a real potential for conflict of interest clearly exists. Newington's full [list of clients](http://newingtoncomms.co.uk/our-clients) includes major developers such as Barratt, Berkeley, British Land, Countryside Properties and Grosvenor - all of which have major development/land interests in Southwark.

Cllr Lury's ward is North Walworth, which comprises the [Heygate](http://35percent.org/heygate-regeneration-faq/) and [Aylesbury](http://35percent.org/aylesbury-estate/) estates.

Cllr Lury is therefore well placed to advise developers on controversial matters in property and planning.

Cllr Fleming along with Cllr Garfield were the only two people to stand up and speak in support of the Aylesbury redevelopment at the [planning application hearing in 2015](http://35percent.org/2015-04-26-aylesbury-applications-approved/). He also spoke at a [Council meeting](http://youtu.be/GlTuN-ffEZk) against [Aylesbury leaseholders](http://halag.wordpress.com) being offering like-for-like replacements for their homes on a council estate elsewhere in the borough. Councillor Fleming is Southwark's only Councillor to [describe](http://pwfpwfpwf.blogspot.co.uk/2016/06/why-i-have-no-choice-but-to-keepcorbyn.html) himself as both a Jacobite and a Corbynite and to [publicly endorse](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8825) Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.

According to her [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/fionacolley) profile Fiona now works as an independent consultant advising tech companies on how to get contracts with local authorities. During her time on the Council, she oversaw the conception of many regeneration schemes including the Heygate estate and Canada Water regeneration. She liked the latter scheme so much that she bought two flats off-plan from the developer (and then flipped them on once they had been built)[^1].  

## Catherine Bowman

She was also Cabinet Member for Regeneration and progressed to the hold the position as deputy Council leader under the brief Lib-Dem/Tory administration. She went on to [work for developer Berkeley Homes](https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/catherine-bowman/86/291/76b) as an 'External Affairs Advisor' and then set up shop with former deputy leader Kim Humphries under the name of ['Carvil Ventures Ltd'](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/).

## Mark Williams
<img src="http://35percent.org/img/markwilliamskatharinemorshead.jpg" width="160" style="margin:10px" align="left">Mark Williams is the current Labour administration's Cabinet member for Regeneration. It wasn't until 2016 that he registered his wife's occupation under his [register of interests](http://moderngov.southwark.gov.uk/mgDeclarationSubmission.aspx?UID=1800&HID=1824&FID=0&HPID=620269417).

No need to wonder then where Southwark's love affair with PRS development has originated. The [New Southwark Plan](http://www.2.southwark.gov.uk/downloads/download/4346/new_southwark_plan_preferred_option) has a whole section praising the merits of PRS and at Elephant & Castle alone the Council is giving planning consent for nearly 2000 PRS homes.
