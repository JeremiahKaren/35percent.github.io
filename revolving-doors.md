A [report](http://www.spinwatch.org/index.php/component/k2/item/5458-the-local-lobby-and-the-failure-of-democracy) by journalist Anna Minton has found that _"20  per  cent  of  Southwark’s  63 councillors work as lobbyists"_ for developers in the planning industry and that a significant number of Councillors and Council officers are making use of a _'well-oiled revolving door'_ to the industry. Here we have documented a few of the most striking examples.

## Councillors

<img src="http://www.fourcommunications.com/sites/default/files/styles/four_square/public/people/jeremy.png" style="margin:10px" align="left" height="200" width="200">After handing over to Lib Dem Leader Nick Stanton in 2002, Southwark's Labour Council Leader [Jeremy Fraser](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-fraser-362a6a2a), Southwark's Councillor for Regeneration (Steve Lancashire) and Lambeth Labour's [Jim Dickson](http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=165) teamed up to [found a consultancy](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,10971,440,00.htm) offering developers _"political support in the face of public opposition"_ to their planning proposals. The company they founded is called ['Four Communications'](http://www.fourcommunications.com/) and has assisted developers on a [large number](http://betterelephant.org/blog/2014/10/19/gamekeepers-turned-poachers/) of high-profile South Bank developments.


Nick Stanton, former Lib Dem council leader who was [critcised for lack of transparency](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4230) after [selecting Lend Lease](http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/4712) as the council's development partner in 2007, is now an [Associate Director](http://www.curtinandco.com/our-people/community-politics/) for property development PR company 'Curtin & Co'. On Stanton's profile page for the company he writes _"I enjoy working on strategic allocations enabling controversial sites to come forward for development."_ Under his list of major accomplishments he boasts _"Winning approval at committee for a major development on a greenfield site"_ Amongst others, Curtin is currently advising developers on the controversial [Southwark Metals development](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lib-dem-deputy-investigated-over-lobbying-8395968.html) in Bermondsey for which Stanton's party received a donation.

After having [left the council in 2010](http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,17488,185,00.htm), former Deputy Council Leader Kim Humphries is now working on projects in Southwark as a development consultant. He has set up shop as [_Carvil Ventures_](http://carvil-ventures.co.uk/) advising developers on controversial schemes such as the [Borough High st development](http://m.bdonline.co.uk/news/king%E2%80%99s-college-under-siege-from-heritage-lobby/5056527.article), the ['Quill'](http://35percent.org/the-quill), the [Canada Water regeneration](http://35percent.org/canada-water) and the [shopping centre redevelopment](http://35percent.org/shopping-centre) at Elephant & Castle - many schemes which he himself conceived while in office.

In fact, amongst others he is currently advising Peabody on its [Borough Triangle](http://35percent.org/borough-triangle/) development, which is proposing zero social rented housing. In 2015, Mr Glover posed as a local businessman in a [Labour party election promo](https://youtu.be/QeB3GU6rWEc).
